                                    <h2>Position of a postdoctoral research fellow in blockchain technologies is available with the group of Networks and Distributed systems at UiO</h2>
                                        <p><a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/nd/">The group of Networks and Distributed systems</a> at the Informatics Department, University of Oslo has a position of a postdoctoral research fellow in blockchain technologies. The position is in the context of the project called <a href="https://www.smartmed.no">SmartMed: Secure and accountable sharing of medical records using smart contracts and blockchain</a>.</p>
                                        <p>The research will be done in collaboration with Cornell University, which is one of leading research centers in the world in the area of blockchain.</p>
                                        <p>As part of strategic security research, blockchain engineering is a prioritized topic at the Department of Informatics. In particular, the postdoctoral researcher will have an opportunity to shape the formation of currently established Blockchain Lab. Furthermore, blockchain research is supported by the <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/conserns/">ConSeRNS initiative</a>, which targets absolutely essential research challenges in security and robustness of ICT infrastructures. ConSeRNS is part of a national Center for Resilient Networks and Applications (CRNA), which spans Simula Research Laboratory, the University of Bergen as well as the University of Oslo.</p>
                                    <h4>SmartMed project summary</h4>
                                        <p>Increasing amounts of health data are recorded in health registries, with the strategic initiatives of data sharing and fusion across different registries in Norway. This forms an excellent opportunity for world-class medical research as few countries have such a high-quality infrastructure. However, it also constitutes a very high privacy risk should a security breach occur.</p>
                                        <p>Publicized incidents of leaked medical records pose a major challenge for the digital trust in eHealth where storing, accessing and exchanging sensitive patient-related data must comply with several regulations, while remaining accessible to authorized health practitioners. Governmental legislations regarding data privacy, such as the EU's GDPR, present an additional source of concern for healthcare registries which are now faced with severe legal and financial consequences in case data confidentiality is breached.</p>
                                        <p>Our principal approach is to facilitate solutions for health registries by using Smart Contracts and the emerging Blockchain Paradigm. From the data safety, authenticity, and nonrepudiation standpoint, blockchain is a perfect fit for sharing medical records since it provides an easily accessible, immutable, and transparent history of all contract-related data, adequate for building applications with trust and accountability. Use of smart contracts brings a number of additional advantages for sharing medical data by healthcare registries: consent management, fine-grain privacy control, transparency, and reduced bureaucracy and expenses.</p>
                                        <p>SmartMed is proposed in cooperation with the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN), which will validate technological advances. CRN presently contains health information on over 1,4 million cancer patients. Managing and using the data for medical research in a secure way as to minimize any privacy concerns is paramount. Improving privacy control and transparency will bolster public's trust in the use of CRN data for vital research on preventive medicine.</p>
                                        <p>We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher who is interested in designing, developing, and evaluating techniques related to the above.</p>
